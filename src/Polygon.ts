/**
 * This function is based on the idea that the cross product between v1 and v2 is
 * norm(v1) * norm(v2) * sin(alpha) where
 * alpha is the angle between the vectors. By going through each line segment as a vector and
 * taking the cross product,
 * we see if sin(alpha) is mostly positive or negative. Positive here meaning the vectors
 * are turning right, negative meaning they are turning left.
 * @param lineSegments
 * Array of line segments to check, note that they have to define a polygon by defining a
 * closed shape (ie. the last line must end where the first line starts.).
